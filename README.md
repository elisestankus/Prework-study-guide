# Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide webpage was created to help coding bootcamp students review the material that was covered in the prework. The study guide webpage is organized into four sections; HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript; in order to make it easier for students to find the relevant notes they are looking for. In addition to being a helpful study aid, building this webpage also provided a valuable learning experience that taught me the basics of web development.
